# Particle Sensor Hub

The principle behind this project is to have a robust and small sensor
architecture powered by the Particle Photon for easy tracking and reaction to
environmental state and changes.

# Setup
1. Setup your Particle Photon. Run `particle setup` after retrieving the
   [CLI](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/).
2. Now flash the code to your Photon by running `particle flash your_device_name
   main` and the code should start executing shortly.
